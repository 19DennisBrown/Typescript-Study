A TUPLE is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index.

// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'Coding God was here'];

//Readonly Tuples.
const ourReadonlyTuple: readonly [number, boolean, string] = [5, true, 'The Real Coding Dev'];

//Named Tuples
Named tuples allow us to provide context for our values at each index.

Example
const graph: [x: number, y: number] = [55.2, 41.3];

//Destructuring Tuples
const graph: [number, number] = [55.2, 41.3];
const [x, y] = graph;
